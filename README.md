# SMotaal/Experimental

Don't dare say it does not work — until it absolutely does not work.

**If you like unfinished stuff**:

* [Markup](./markup)

**If you like really unfinished stuff**:

* [Modules](./modules)
* [Fragma](./fragma)

**If you don't like the above**<sup>\[ⅰ\]</sup>:

* [@SMotaal/tokenizer](./markup/packages/tokenizer)

  A refactored tokenizer from earlier markup experiments.

* [pseu·dom](./markup/packages/pseudom)

  Abstractional document composition without the actual DOM.

\[ⅰ\]: You may be looking for packages, which are not really my thing and that can sometimes be exactly what you need if you are looking for good hackable matter.
