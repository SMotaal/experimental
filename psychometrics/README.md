An experimental JSON-based implementation of various popular psychometric self-report questionairre instruments.

This project intented for all the work to be open source and fully operational on the client-side. This affords a level of transparency and privacy that can be guarnteed both ethically and architecturally.

**Responsible Disclosures**

1. This project was initally developed as part of my volunteering efforts in one of the Autism communities not disclosed here.
   - I'd like to express my gratitude and respect to everyone involved in such communities. I also especially want to recognize and thank those who go out of their way and often beyond their means trying to do what is meaningful to make a difference.
   - Community memebers interested in including more psychometrics in this repository may reach out by [opening an issue on this repository](https://github.com/SMotaal/experimental/issues/new).
2. This project includes data files for several existing psychometric instruments that were developed by their respective authors.
   - I'd like to express my gratitude and respect to all those authors. I'd also especially want to recognize and thank those who go out of their way to make their psychometrics publically available.
   - Authors of psychometric instruments included in this repository may reach out to me [by opening an issue on this repository](https://github.com/SMotaal/experimental/issues/new) and I will do everything necessary to remove all public facing artifacts for their respective instruments.
3. This code now lives in the public domain with the following considerations to anyone referencing it:
   - I write code, I am always happy to leave it in the public domain so that others may reference it in their own implementation.
     > **Note**: This is experimental code and not code ready for production, this takes a lot more work.
   - I don't own nor license any of the tests in any capacity.
     > **Note**: All included tests were found in open access publications.
   - All ethical and legal responsibilities towards the original authors must be assumed by any individuals opting to reference this code.
