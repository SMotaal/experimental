   - [ ] Yes
   - [ ] No

### Summary

If you’ve spent your life ‘faking normal, you might not look autistic to the casual observer. So I’ve made a questionnaire that’s tailored to the masking autistic adult.

This isn’t an official test, and I am not a doctor. But if you find yourself answering ‘yes’ to many of these questions, you might want to look into the possibility that you’re an undiagnosed autistic.
