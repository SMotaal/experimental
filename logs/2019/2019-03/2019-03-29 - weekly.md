<blockquote>So I started taking the fun out of this in the past few weeks, and that made it a chore… no more chores!</blockquote>

## <kbd>IMPLEMENT</kbd> Markout's In-place Navigation

This serious upgrade is one step shy from supporting a full `.nojekyll` publishing solution right from GitHub pages.

<aside>

It takes very little effort from here to make a true [SPA](https://github.com/rafrex/spa-github-pages) from all of this over the weekend 🙂

</aside>

All fresh-bundles (finally letting go of `.mjs`) and a completely novel way solution for debugging made it possible to move much faster.

## <kbd>UPDATE</kbd> Markout-content gets a facelift

This is best seen [live](www.smotaal.io)!

## <kbd>REFACTOR</kbd> Tokenizer with all-new harmonized demos

- [`/markup/markup.html`](/markup/markup.html)
- [`@smotaal/tokenizer/examples/browser/index.html`](/markup/packages/@smotaal/tokenizer/examples/browser/index.html)

Markup has been refactored to make room for the next wave of awesome experimentation. Both Markup and Tokenizer now use the single `api.js` with all-new resolver logic that is just magic to work with.

## <kbd>DRAFT</kbd> `jessie-frame` is the little guy

- [`jessie-frame`](/meta/@ses/Jessie-Frame.md)

While I dwell over complexities of `ses-frame`, this new little guy is the much needed gateway. Combining Michael Fig's efforts on Jessica with the original sandboxing spirit cuts a long way towards the more elusive `ses-frame` efforts.
