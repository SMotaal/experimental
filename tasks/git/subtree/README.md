# `tasks/git/subtree`

These tasks utilize `git subtree` to make it possible to work with content from other source repositories as nested folders which may be modified and committed directly into the target repository. This approach handles all `remote` operations locally which gives it more flexibility for forking and hosting when compared with the `git submodule` approach.
